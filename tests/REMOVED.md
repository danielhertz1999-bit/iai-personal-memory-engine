# Removed Tests Audit Trail

Tests removed as part of the Hippo storage backend swap in this release.
Each entry lists the file path, the symbols it tested, and the reason for
removal.

## test_lance_storage_maintenance.py (removed in this release)

Tested `optimize_lance_storage()` and the `lance_storage_optimized` event
kind. Both replaced by `optimize_hippo_storage()` and the `hippo_compacted`
event kind. New coverage in `tests/test_hippo_storage.py`.

## test_self_heal_lance_versions.py (removed in this release)

Tested `_maybe_self_heal_version_pileup` — the sleep-pipeline predicate that
detected runaway LanceDB `_versions/*.manifest` accumulation and triggered
forced compaction. Hippo (SQLite + hnswlib) has no version manifests; the
predicate and its surrounding code were deleted from the sleep pipeline in this release.

## test_daemon_startup_bounded_optimize.py (removed in earlier plan)

Tested `_run_bounded_startup_optimize` and the `IAI_MCP_SKIP_STARTUP_OPTIMIZE`
environment knob. Both were deleted as part of the Hippo migration; startup
compaction no longer exists because Hippo has no version manifests to drain.
Note: this file was already deleted before this audit trail was written.
New boot-health coverage is in
`tests/test_hippo_storage.py::test_boot_integrity_rebuild_when_hnsw_missing`.

## test_optimize_step_drains_edges_lance.py (removed in this release)

Tested an earlier hot-fix self-heal-bypass behavior: when `edges.lance`
version counts exceeded 2x the base threshold the staleness check was skipped.
Hippo has no version pile-up scenario; the bypass code path and the associated
staleness predicate were deleted in this release.

## test_concurrency.py — ProcessLock API tests removed

The pure process-lifecycle-lock tests were removed: shared-vs-exclusive,
exclusive-then-exclusive, flock fd-close safety, multi-holder blocking, SIGKILL
auto-release, the `holds_exclusive_nb` cooperative-yield probe, and the
concurrent-exclusive mutual-exclusion test — plus the spawn-child helpers they
relied on. The lock-file-0o600 half of the permissions test was also removed.
Reason: the process-lifecycle lock was removed — a vestigial lifecycle lock with
zero live acquires; the storage lock is the sole contention authority. The
surviving socket control-plane tests (status round-trip, injected dispatcher,
stale-socket cleanup, socket-0o600) were rewritten to drop the lock plumbing.

## test_daemon.py — ProcessLock shutdown/yield tests removed

The shutdown test that asserted the daemon closed a process-lifecycle lock on
exit, and the cooperative-yield probe test that exercised `holds_exclusive_nb`,
were removed. Reason: the daemon no longer constructs or closes a
process-lifecycle lock, and the in-process yield gate is gone; shutdown
cleanliness is now owned by the lifecycle marker release.

## test_identity_audit.py — ProcessLock-monkeypatch half removed

The runtime half that monkeypatched the process-lifecycle lock's acquire methods
to a raiser (to prove the identity audit never took the lock) was removed: the
premise is moot once the class is gone. The static source-scan guard
(identity_audit.py does not import the concurrency lock) is retained and passes.

## Recovery

Each removed file is preserved in git history. To restore any of them:

    git log --diff-filter=D --summary -- tests/test_X.py
    git checkout <pre-removal-sha> -- tests/test_X.py

For tests removed from a file that still exists, restore from the pre-removal
commit:

    git show <pre-removal-sha>:tests/test_X.py
