"""-- atomic daemon state persistence ( / ).

State file at ~/.iai-mcp/.daemon-state.json holds:
- fsm_state               -- WAKE / TRANSITIONING / SLEEP / DREAMING
- daemon_started_at       -- ISO8601 UTC
- last_digest_shown_at    -- ISO8601 UTC, used by morning digest gate
- pending_digest          -- dict ready to surface in next memory_recall
- last_learned_at         -- last quiet-window learn timestamp
- last_session_ts         -- last observed session_started event ts

All writes via tempfile + os.replace (POSIX atomic rename). Crash-mid-write
leaves the old file intact; readers either see old complete or new complete,
never partial.

T-04-01 mitigation: atomic rename precludes torn writes.
T-04-07 mitigation: file mode 0o600 user-only.
