"""Autistic-cognition profile registry -- 11 sealed knobs (10 AUTIST + 1 wake_depth),
Bayesian tuner, camouflaging + double_empathy invariants. Populated by Wave 3 migrations.

Wave 9: retrieval-policy RL and trust refinement are exposed from lilli.profile.tuner.

This package re-exports the public surface of ``lilli.profile.knobs`` so
consumers can write ``from iai_mcp.lilli.profile import PROFILE_KNOBS`` (or
any of the symbols listed in ``__all__``) WITHOUT having to know that the
implementation lives in the ``knobs`` submodule. The package boundary is
the supported public-API path; the submodule path is an implementation
detail that may be reshaped in a future extraction.
